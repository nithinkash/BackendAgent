Users: This entity will store information about all the users who have registered on the e-commerce platform. It will include fields such as user ID, username, email, password, address, phone number, etc. \n\n2. Products: This entity will store information about all the products available for sale on the e-commerce platform. It will include fields such as product ID, name, description, price, quantity, category, brand, etc. \n\n3. Orders: This entity will store information about all the orders placed by users on the e-commerce platform. It will include fields such as order ID, user ID, product ID, quantity, total price, status, etc. \n\n4. Categories: This entity will store information about all the different categories of products available on the e-commerce platform. It will include fields such as category ID, name, description, etc. \n\n5. Brands: This entity will store information about all the different brands of products available on the e-commerce platform. It will include fields such as brand ID, name, description, etc. \n\n6. Cart: This entity will store information about the items added to the cart by users before placing an order. It will include fields such as user ID, product ID, quantity, etc. \n\nNow, let's discuss some edge cases and details to consider while designing the database schema: \n\n1. Handling Out of Stock Products: Make sure to include a field in the products entity to keep track of the quantity available for each product. When a user tries to place an order for a product that is out of stock, provide a notification and prevent the order from being placed. \n\n2. Handling User Authentication and Authorization: Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect user data and ensure that only authorized users can access and modify data in the database. \n\n3. Handling Order Status Updates: Implement a mechanism to update the status of orders as they progress through different stages such as processing, shipping, delivered, etc. \n\n4. Handling Payment Processing: Implement a secure payment processing system to facilitate online payments for orders. Make sure to encrypt sensitive payment information to ensure data security. \n\n5. Handling Search Functionality: Implement a search functionality that allows users to easily search for products based on various criteria such as name, category, brand, price, etc. \n\nBy considering these edge cases and details, you can design a robust and efficient e-commerce database schema to handle all the requirements of your e-commerce platform. Let me know if you need any further assistance with the database design process."
