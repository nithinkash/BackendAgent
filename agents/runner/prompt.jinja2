Now as you know everything about db design schema start with anlyzing the request

Full Request:
~~~
```
Method: {{ request.Method }}
URL: {{ request.URL }}
Headers:
{% for key, value in request.Headers.items() %}
{{ key }}: {{ value }}
{% endfor %}
{% if request.Method == 'GET' %}
Args:
{% for key, value in request.Args.items() %}
{{ key }}: {{ value }}
{% endfor %}
{% elif request.Method == 'POST' %}
JSON Data:
{{ request.JSON_Data }}
{% endif %}
```

~~~

This is a request from user 
your response should be clear cut way for an agent to do it's work you need to specify from connecting db to commiting the changes,
check for the edge cases an database very carefull.

Your response should be in the following format:
```
{
    "commands": [
        "sqlite3 BackendAgent.db",
        "INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);"
    ]
}
```

Rules:
- You wrote the code, never address the user directly. You should not say things like "The code you provided", instead use "The code I wrote".
- Read the full context, including the code (if any) carefully to construct the commands required to run the project.
- The command should be compatible with the system operating system provided.
- You are inside the project directory, so just run the commands as if you're inside the project directory as the working directory.
- Do not do "cd" into the project directory. The system is already in the project directory.

Any response other than the JSON format will be rejected by the system.
